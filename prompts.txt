refined prompt

Write a Javascript function to convert strings to camelCase.
- lowecase all words

To make your prompt even more robust, consider adding:

    Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-string inputs).
    Consideration for multiple word separators, like hyphens and underscores.
    Handling cases with abbreviations or acronyms to keep them intact without converting to lowercase.

v3

Task: Create a JavaScript function named totoKebabCase that robustly converts an input string into kebab-case.

The function must follow this specific order of operations to handle various inputs correctly.

Functional Requirements:

    Input Validation:

        First, check if the input is null, undefined, or not of type string.

        If the input is invalid, return the exact error message: "Input must be a valid string."

    Handle Empty String:

        If the input is a valid but empty string (""), return an empty string.

    Trim Whitespace:

        Remove all leading and trailing whitespace from the string (e.g., using trim()).

    Lowercase:

        Convert the entire string to lowercase (e.g., using toLowerCase()).

    Normalize Characters:

        Replace all characters that are not a lowercase letter (a-z), a number (0-9), or a whitespace character with a single space. This includes all punctuation, emojis, and other special symbols.

    Hyphenate:

        Replace all occurrences of one or more consecutive whitespace characters with a single hyphen (-).

Examples to Test:

    "Hello World" should return "hello-world"

    " Hello! World 😃 " should return "hello-world"

    "Another___Test" should return "another-test"

    "Input with !punctuation." should return "input-with-punctuation"

    "Multiple spaces" should return "multiple-spaces"

    "ALL CAPS" should return "all-caps"

    null should return "Input must be a valid string."

    "" should return ""
